# Workshop Prerequisites

This document describes all pre-workshop environment requirements and how to run the corresponding validation checks.
Each prerequisite lives in its own directory for clarity, and common logic is provided under the relevant sub-folders.

All participants **must** complete these checks before the workshop to ensure smooth execution of all hands-on
exercises.

## 1. Hardware Requirements

Participants must have access to:

- **A laptop or workstation** with a stable terminal or SSH client.

- **Linux/macOS**: native terminal is sufficient.

- **A modern web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) for Zoom.

- **A headset and microphone** for communication during online sessions

## 2. Network Access

- Participants connecting **from outside KAUST** must ensure they have a working **KAUST VPN connection**.

    - Verify VPN access at least one day before the workshop.

- Test that you can connect to the IBEX login node via:

    ```commandline
    ssh username@glogin.ibex.kaust.edu.sa
    ```

## 3. IBEX Login and Environment Setup

Before the workshop:

- Ensure your **IBEX account is active and accessible**.

    - If you don’t yet have access, contact [training@hpc.kaust.edu.sa](training@hpc.kaust.edu.sa).

- Once logged in, clone the workshop materials:

    ```commandline
    git clone https://github.com/kaust-rccl/Dist-DL-training.git
    ```

## 4. Recommended Prior Sessions

To get the most out of this workshop, it is **strongly recommended** that participants have:

Completed the **KAUST Data Science Onboarding** session (or equivalent).

Basic familiarity with:

- Python programming

- HPC environments (modules, Slurm jobs)

- Version control with Git

## 5. Pre-Workshop Verification (Sample Run)

## Expected Output

### File System Check Output

#### Access check for personal directory `/ibex/user/$USER` Summary

```commandline
[✓] Path exists: /ibex/user/<username>
[✓] Permissions OK (rwx)
[✓] Write test passed
[✓] Read test passed
[✓] Delete test passed
/ibex/user/<username> is accessible.
```

#### Request access for `tinyimagenet` directory

Many training exercises use the TinyImageNet dataset stored in the shared data repository on IBEX.
Please request access before the workshop as follows:

- Log in to [https://my.ibex.kaust.edu.sa/](https://my.ibex.kaust.edu.sa/) using your IBEX username and password.

- From the top menu, go to Reference.

- In the search box, type “tinyimagenet”.

- Click Request Access next to the dataset entry.

- Wait for approval confirmation (usually processed within one working day).

Once approved, the dataset will be accessible under the shared reference directory:

````commandline
/ibex/reference/CV/tinyimagenet
````

#### Access check for `tinyimagenet` directory

Now that your access is approved, the summary for `tinyimagenet` directory check should look like this:

```commandline
[✓] Path exists and is a directory
[✓] Permissions allow read/list
[✓] Readability test passed (listed contents and read a file)

Access to /ibex/reference/CV/tinyimagenet verified.
```

### GPU Check Output (Submission Only)

Example:

```commandline
[V100] Submitting single-GPU check...
Submitted batch job xxxxxxxx
[A100] Submitting multi-node check...
Submitted batch job xxxxxxxx
```

**This is NOT the actual sanity result** — you must inspect the logs.

#### ⚠️ You MUST Check the GPU Logs

For all GPU jobs, the real outputs are written to:

```commandline
<submission_path>/log/
```

Each job creates a log file such as:

```commandline
log/single_v100_gpu-42123456.out
log/multi_a100_nodes-42123460.out
```

**Success Criteria**

A participant passes the sanity checks when:

- **All logs** show `[✓]` for allocation, reachability, and GPU visibility

- No `[✗]` markers or SLURM step errors appear

- `nvidia-smi` lists the expected GPU models (V100 or A100)

## If Any Check Fails

If any check fails, please contact [training@hpc.kaust.edu.sa](training@hpc.kaust.edu.sa).

### Include:

- The failing check name
- Any relevant log file(s)
- Your username
- Error message or screenshot

This helps us diagnose issues quickly before the workshop begins.
